      <h1>How to Play?</h1>
      <p>
        This card game, inspired by the GLOBE Program and environmental science, is designed to engage players in solving real-world ecological challenges. Players take on the roles of scientists working in different ecosystems, collecting data, and using their expertise to tackle environmental issues. Here’s a breakdown of the game mechanics and rules:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Theme and Objective</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Players assume the roles of environmental scientists, exploring various biomes (such as forests, wetlands, and deserts) to gather data according to GLOBE protocols.</li>
        <li>The goal is to level up your expertise as a scientist by completing tasks and solving environmental challenges. The first player to reach the highest level of expertise wins and is crowned the Master Researcher.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Character Roles</h2>
      <p>Each player chooses a character role that represents a specific type of environmental scientist. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atmospheric Scientist</strong>: Specializes in weather and climate data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrologist</strong>: Focuses on water quality and hydrological protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil Specialist</strong>: Collects and analyzes soil samples.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Cover Expert</strong>: Maps and studies land use and vegetation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each role has unique skills or advantages in certain tasks, encouraging players to strategize based on their character’s strengths.</p>

      <h2>3. Environmental Challenges</h2>
      <p>Instead of fighting monsters or enemies, players encounter environmental challenges such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drought</strong>: Collect and analyze hydrological data to assess its impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution</strong>: Test water or soil samples to determine pollution levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Use atmospheric data to understand climate trends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Players must utilize the appropriate GLOBE protocol for each challenge. Successfully completing these challenges earns the player points, leveling them up as a scientist.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Scientific Tools and Bonuses</h2>
      <p>Replace typical in-game items with scientific tools and bonuses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precision Thermometer</strong>: Enhances the accuracy of temperature measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Water Testing Kit</strong>: Provides an advantage in hydrological challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Satellite Imagery</strong>: Gives a bonus in land cover mapping tasks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Players can also gain cooperation bonuses, such as working with citizen scientists or securing additional research funding, providing strategic benefits.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Leveling Up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Players gain levels by completing tasks and collecting data as per GLOBE protocols. Each completed task contributes to their scientific expertise.</li>
        <li>The first player to reach a predetermined level (e.g., Level 10) wins the game and is recognized as a top-level scientist.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Player Interactions</h2>
      <p>Players can help or hinder each other by introducing complications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bad Weather</strong>: Forces a player to repeat atmospheric data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment Malfunction</strong>: Slows down data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Inaccuracy</strong>: Causes players to re-verify their data, taking extra turns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Card Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Protocol Cards</strong>: Represent the specific GLOBE protocols players must follow to collect data and overcome challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Cards</strong>: Present environmental scenarios that players must address using their scientific expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>Tool Cards</strong>: Provide scientific instruments or bonuses to help players collect data more efficiently.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This game emphasizes teamwork, environmental education, and strategic thinking as players navigate through real-world challenges using scientific protocols.
